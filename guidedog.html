<p>The Guide Dog Foundation for the blind, established in 1946, was made for the purpose of providing the blind with guide dogs for <i>free</i>. The headquarters are located in New York; however, campuses and programs across America help help raise and condition the guide puppies before their intense training. Athens started the program about 10 years ago and its popularity has risen tremendously since.</p>
<p> The training requires an <span style="underline">extensive amount of time and dedication</span>. The program trains the puppies to become accustomed to different surroundigs such as cafeterias, classrooms, crowded buses, and restaurants. Additionally, the trainees teach the puppies basic commands, routes, and responses to specific safety hazards including ramps, doors, and stairs. This training lasts about a year and many say the most challenging part of the program is giving the dogs up for service after their training is complete.</p>
<p> All in all, the Guide Dog Foundation is an incredible service that helps thousands of blind people all around the world for years to come. You can also get involved in this program, click <a href="https://www.uga.edu/about_uga/profile/helping-to-guide-others/">here</a> for more information and additional first hand experience with the Guide Dog Foundation at UGA.</p>
